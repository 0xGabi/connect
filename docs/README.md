# Aragon Connect

Welcome to the Aragon Connect documentation.

* The **Guides** section contains guides that will help you build a dapp using Aragon Connect.
* The **Advanced** section contains guides that are helpful if you want to write your own app connector, or if you want to have a deeper understanding on how things work.
* The **API Reference** section contains a complete documentation of the functions and objects exposed by the library.

If you never used the library before, we highly recommend starting with the [Getting Started](https://github.com/aragon/connect/tree/1a1988fd498bb0ea8b6bcc864cf4e3d6ac2b5a26/docs/guides/getting-started/README.md) guide.
